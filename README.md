# Customer_churan_prediction
This project can implement customer churn prediction using several machine learning models:

*   **Logistic Regression:** A simple and interpretable model for binary classification.

*   **Decision Tree Classifier:** A tree-based model that makes predictions by recursively partitioning the feature space.

*   **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

*   **Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost):** Another powerful ensemble method that builds trees sequentially.

*   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**  Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

*   **Neural Networks:**  Can learn complex patterns but require more data and tuning.

*   **Other Models:** You can include other models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, etc.

For each method, briefly explain its principles and any specific parameters used.
